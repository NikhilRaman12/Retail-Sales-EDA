📌 Project Overview
This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a retail inventory and sales dataset. As a Data Analyst with domain expertise in AI training, Life Sciences, Agritech, and FoodTech, I applied analytical techniques to uncover hidden patterns, regional trends, and sales behaviors across categories and units.

The primary objective was to identify sales bottlenecks, inventory inefficiencies, and optimize pricing strategies through correlation analysis, regional breakdowns, and visual storytelling.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Colab Notebook)

Pandas – data cleaning & transformation

NumPy – array operations and calculation logic

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter/Colab Notebook – code environment

🔍 Key Steps Performed
📥 1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration
Loaded retail inventory-sales dataset

Explored data shape, types, null values, and basic statistics

🧹 2. Data Cleaning
Treated missing values and null entries

Standardized categorical data

Corrected data types for analysis-ready format

📊 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Category-wise, Region-wise, and Product-wise sales breakdown

Visualized patterns in:

Units Sold

Average Unit Price

Inventory Cost

Created a Correlation Matrix to identify feature relationships

📌 4. Visualizations
Bar plots, pie charts, and heatmaps to represent:

Regional sales patterns

Inventory trends

Category comparisons

Correlation among numerical features

📈 Correlation Matrix Interpretation

Note: Replace with actual image path or link.

The correlation heatmap helped uncover how unit cost, unit price, and inventory values interact.

Some variables like Units Sold showed weaker correlation with price, suggesting non-price-driven factors such as brand, seasonality, or region affecting sales.

💡 Business Insights
🔍 Category Performance:
Beverages and Snacks outperform others in terms of units sold, pointing to high turnover products worth prioritizing.

📍 Regional Sales Disparity:
The West region displays high inventory but low unit sales, suggesting a probable overstocking issue. It may benefit from targeted marketing or redistribution.

💰 Pricing Strategy:
Despite high unit prices in some categories, sales volume is not proportionally high — indicating a need for price sensitivity or segmentation analysis.

📦 Stock Optimization:
Irregular sales patterns in some categories indicate seasonality or ineffective stock planning. These categories require dynamic inventory models.

📈 Correlation Insight:
The matrix reveals that unit cost and inventory values are closely linked, but sales volume is relatively independent of price, possibly due to necessity-driven demand.
