## 📊 Final Business Insights

🔍 **1. Strong Correlation Between Units Sold, Sales, and Profit**  
A strong positive correlation was observed between `Units Sold`, `Sales Revenue`, and `Profit`, confirming that increasing sales volumes positively impacts both revenue and profitability.

🌍 **2. Uniform Sales Distribution Across Regions**  
The sales distribution across `North`, `South`, `East`, and `West` regions was fairly **even**, indicating no significant regional variation in performance.

📦 **3. High Sales Driven by Product Outliers**  
Each region had a few **high-performing outlier products**, possibly due to **seasonal trends, promotions, or flagship items**. These outliers present an opportunity for focused marketing.

📉 **4. Slight Negative Correlation Between Inventory and Profit**  
A mild **negative relationship** was found between inventory levels and profit, suggesting that **excess inventory may reduce profitability**, highlighting the need for better inventory control.
